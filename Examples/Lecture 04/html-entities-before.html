 		"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumblees, or where the door of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valaintly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds ; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotion; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails whike daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat."
